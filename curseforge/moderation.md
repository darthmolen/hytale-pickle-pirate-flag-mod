What happens in Moderation?
CurseForge has a large collection of mods which all go through a series of processors, automated checks, and manual reviewing.
The team works hard to prevent abuse of the platform and puts in great efforts to make sure CurseForge is a safe, fun, and engaging space for authors and players alike.


In case you feel there is an inappropriate project that passed moderation, you can report it via the reporting function in the website. We also invite you to use the ticketing system if you encounter a problematic file, and open an issue with supporting information.


In the instances that a project or file was approved but raises a copyright question (On the content or technical level), the original owner of that content can make a claim by following these guidelines and citing the reason for us to review again.
This process is what makes CurseForge the safest and most trusted source for mods.



What happens when a project doesn't qualify?

If your project submission received a reply that changes are required, or that it was rejected altogether - This guide should help you understand the reasoning better.

Note that these messages are generated either automatically by the system, or by the moderator staff. You can identify a staff member by the Admin tag on their user profile.



DO NOT delete your project or file and try to upload it all again to solve a rejection message, it will only make things more complicated for everyone :)



General Guidelines
Projects should add value to players while respecting the game creators and the game itself.
Projects should not encourage any sort of discrimination, in any way.
CurseForge follows game developers EULA and ToS, and so should your projects. This is true for content and functionality alike.
Your project should contain distinct content and assets, including in its name, avatar, summary and description. If your project is a fork of another project and allowed by their license - credit and link the original creator and make sure forking is allowed to begin with.
Moderation is done under our best efforts. You can appeal a rejection, ask for clarification or report a project if you feel they are inappropriate, and are reminded to be respectful at all times. 
It is strongly recommended that you enable a communication channel with your audience to allow bug reporting and feature requests as well as feedback.
CurseForge supports authors by ads and subscriptions which do not interfere with the players’ in-game experience. We expect the same from the authors who submit projects to the platform.
Projects on CurseForge are first and foremost for the CurseForge community.

Therefore, it is essential that each project provides comprehensive information about its mod functionality, support, and relevant content directly on CurseForge.

Any promotional or non-descriptive content and information, including but not limited to: 

Server hosting affiliate banners (with the exception of the integrated Bisect Hosting banner)
Personal donations (such as ko-fi, Patreon, etc..)
Personal websites
Cross-hosting or portfolio pages leading outside of the platform

must appear at the bottom of the page, following the project description.
In addition, any such content must be of reasonable size and relevant content so as to not overwhelm the description page and distract users from the project's relevant information.

It is allowed to use dependency badges or functional link badges at the top similar to the below for cross-hosting/social linking purposes but those must not include any promotional material.  


We recommend reviewing our author support section and articles for more information regarding project requirements, submissions and moderation.

Description 
Clear and Informative Description	Your description should include what your project adds or changes in the game. If it is a fork, you must describe what has changed from the original and you cannot copy the description of the original project.

The description can include descriptive and storytelling langauge, but it must also contain functional information so the players know what your mod does.

Avoid using generic terms: "Changes the core/vanilla game" or "adds items to the game" is not enough.
Clear Summary	Your Summary is like a tldr for your Description. You can provide a more high level general description here, preferably no longer than 1 sentence.
Try to avoid copying the same text from the description.
English content	Names must be in English.
Descriptions and Summaries can have other languages in addition, but must have English translations that appear before other languages.
Name - functional Information	Names should not contain game name, versions, file versions ect.... Any technical information belongs in the description or relevant file tagging.
Project Avatar	Avatars must not be solid colors, contain anything NSFW or copyrighted imagery.
All avatars need to be 400x400 pixels.
Note - There is a known bug currently with webp formats, avoid using those
Inappropriate Project	Projects that either do not appear to be the correct content for the current category, game, or adult content in an age restricted game or otherwise deemed inappropriate by moderation.
NSFW and 18+ content would normally be prohibited (nudity, adult substances, etc.)
Third Party Downloads	External download links for files are not allowed.
Texture Pack Missing Sample	Texture Packs/Resource Packs or other visual mods must have a sample image showing accurate in-game representation of the content.
Content Copyright	If you upload a project that is using copyrighted content from other registered works or belonging to other authors on the platform, you must either be allowed to do so under their respective license or have explicit permission to do so. Either way getting permission from the content owner is recommended, and a proper credit is also required.

Accounts found to be abusing this can be subject to a permanent ban.
Anti-Griefing	Content that is used to harass, discriminate or negatively impact players in-game in any way is not allowed.
Fair Play	It is not allowed to upload multiple similar and/or low effort projects in an attempt to game the system.

These can include but are not limited to:
Re-uploads without changes.
Minimal and/or nonfunctional changes.
Intentionally spacing the above in order to create a fake ongoing stream of updates.

Any AI-modified (generated, edited, or enhanced) showcase image that may misrepresent the mod’s actual content must include a clear and visible disclaimer (e.g., on the image or in the description).
