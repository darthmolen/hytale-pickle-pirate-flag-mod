# Plan

## What We Want

We want a half character tall banner that can be placed in the Hytale world proclaiming that we are a proud pickle pirate as it waves back and forth. This will also place a pin on the map, and right clicking the banner will allow us to name the pin on the map. the ui will look like a sign for naming the pin.

## Goals

1. Create a Flag with a full wooden pole, a crossbar that attaches to the pole, and a flag that hangs down and waves from the cross bar. the cross bar should stick out slighly more than the pole to the other side of the down draped flag.
2. Learn a way that we can automate the workflow process. *MUST NOT* shortcut with manual steps. if we have to fork and make changes to source code, then we shall. It's not just a flag, but a process I can work with claude code for making assets and full blown mods in Hytale.
3. gradle automation for testing.
4. Good documentation on the process we eventually come up with and as a stretch goal, a plugin with a skill for claude code.

## Tools

### Blockbench

1. Hytale Plugin - model, skeleton, animation
2. Blockbench MCP Server - automation tool.

### Tools Source code

1. [BlockBench MCP Server](../research/blockbench-mcp-plugin/)
2. [Hytale Plugin](../research/hytale-blockbench-plugin/)

### Images

Anything that can help us in the automation. This part is a little more nebulous that we need to nail down. I'm okay with nailing this down last though.

1. Gimp
2. ImageMagick?

## Output

A plugin and pack in blockymodel format that

## Examples

1. [Official Model Examples](../research/Hytale%20Model%20Examples/)
2. [Unofficial Landmark Plugin Example](../research/mods/Landmark/)
3. [Assets to Use](../research/HyAssets/)

## Server

1. `/mnt/c/hytale-server`
2. script to start server - `scripts/start-server.bat`

## Execution

### Skills

1. using-superpowers
2. hyper think (not a skill but a mode, I know)

### Phasing

1. small steps: e.g.  (make pole / test, attach flag / test, make flag wave / test, add textures to pole / test, add texture to flag, test)
2. If we go in the wash more than 2 times, stop, and plan.
3. Write thesse phases out as separate documents in planning/ and mark them in progress as well as move them to completed when completed.
